# Introduction

> Quick intro why nuxt.js has been created

## What is Nuxt.js ?

Writing web application with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) is great, but when it's about configuring Webpack and Babel to be able to write `*.vue` files component, it's a bit less enjoyable.

_What about writing a server-rendered web application with Vue.js and using the `*.vue` files?_

We will add more Webpack configuration (you will need a server bundle file), adding a `preFetch` method to fetch the data from the server-side (like [vue-hackernews2.0](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-hackernews-2.0)), creating a node.js server and using `vue-server-renderer`...

Explain the tool + the benefits wanted + vison of the project
