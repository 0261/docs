# Introduction

> The 25th of October 2016, the team behind [zeit.co](https://zeit.co/), announced [Next.js](https://zeit.co/blog/next), a framework for server-rendered React applications. Few hours after the announcement, the idea of creating server-rendered [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) applications the same way as Next.js was obvious: **Nuxt.js** was born.

## What is Nuxt.js ?

Nuxt.js is a framework for creating Universal Vue.js Applications.

Its main scope is **UI rendering** while abstracting away the client/server distribution.

Our goal is to create a framework flexible that you can use as a main project base or in addition to your current project based on Node.js.

Nuxt.js presets all the configuration needed to make your development of a Vue.js Application **Server Rendered** more enjoyable.

In addition, we also provide an other deployment option called: *nuxt generate* that allows you to make **Static Generated** Vue.js Application.
We believe that option could be the next big step in the development of Web Application with microservices.

As a framework, Nuxt.js comes will a lot of features to help you in your development between the client side and the server side such as Asynchronous Data, Middleware, Layouts, etc.

## Server Rendered App

Writing web application with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) is great, but when it's about configuring Webpack and Babel to be able to write `*.vue` files component, it's a bit less enjoyable.

_What about writing a server-rendered web application with Vue.js and using the `*.vue` files?_

We will add more Webpack configuration (you will need a server bundle file), adding a `preFetch` method to fetch the data from the server-side (like [vue-hackernews2.0](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-hackernews-2.0)), creating a node.js server and using `vue-server-renderer`...

Explain the tool + the benefits wanted + vison of the project
